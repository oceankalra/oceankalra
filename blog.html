    <p>
      Artificial intelligence is growing fast and is changing not just technology but also how people think and feel. As AI becomes more than a tool and starts to think and work with us, it reshapes how we reason, create, and make choices. This shift demands skills like good judgment, self-understanding, and the ability to collaborate effectively. People tend to trust AI when it appears competent, communicates clearly, and aligns with their values.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the same time, large language models are helping researchers learn more about how our minds work, showing that understanding, memory, and reasoning often emerge from patterns rather than strict rules. AI that responds to human emotion can support communication and well-being, but it also raises questions about dependency and authenticity.
    </p>

    <p>
      These changes are pushing us to rethink what it means to be smart, creative, or skilled when machines can now perform parts of that work. The goal of working with AI is to elevate human potential like making tasks easier, expanding access to knowledge, and helping us understand ourselves more deeply. The future will depend on how humans and AI work together, not just on how smart machines become. AI should ultimately help Make the People Great Again! Until next time.

      AI this, AI that, what about the Human part though? The evolution and advancement of AI has led to countries trying to compete and build better models leading to a recent surge in a want to get a foothold of places and materials which is behind the production of chips used to make these models. The major point is AI takes massive amount of water to load itself, tilting towards yet another concerning question, will this change the direction of interest in places and materials? This advancement coming as a result of deprecating and straining our natural resources. I feel the best use is a moderate one. These chain of events has led to mix of fear, uncertainty, and less use of personal intellect, on an individual level. Socially, it has changed the dynamics altogether with people in favor of digital dopamine rather than face-to-face interactions and networking, though not always the case.    </p>

    <p>
      With all these developments incoming, and many more in the queue, are we preparing ourselves to see AI as a supporter rather than an initiator? I purposefully wouldn't call it a helper, since this role isn't always the weaker or submissive one as perceived in many contexts, so it doesn't fit. As the Hebrew term for helper is ēzer, and this refers to help in a life-saving/military way, and not domestic/subordinate help (so technically Eve isn't the helper perceived, since  ēzer implies essential strength or rescue and not inferiority, food for thought).    </p>

    <p>
      Back to the article, ultimately, agency and conscious play a huge role in choosing our dynamics and relation with this ever changing landcape of AI, and this part matters the most. Until next time.    </p>
